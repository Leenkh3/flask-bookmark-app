##  Project Summary: Flask Bookmark Manager
________________________________________
## Purpose of the Project
The Flask Bookmark Manager is a web application designed to help users manage their bookmarks efficiently. The primary goal of the project is to provide a user-friendly platform where users can:
•	Save and organize their favorite links.
•	Automatically fetch metadata (title and description) for added links.
•	Filter and sort bookmarks based on tags and other criteria.
This project demonstrates the use of modern web development tools and techniques, including Flask for backend development, SQLite for database management, and Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
